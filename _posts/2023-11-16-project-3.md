# Some thoughts about Project 3
Our repo is located [here](https://github.com/ViviFeathers/ST558-PROJECT-3.git) which has the final ["readme"](https://vivifeathers.github.io/ST558-PROJECT-3/) in the main branch. 

## What would I do differently?
The entering process was very uneasy and filled with waiting, I know it was a uncontrollable situation but I still wish I could have done the entire project by myself from the very beginning or cooperated with someone else.
I finished programming for all six models, the last model was not ideal because I detected errors from the model my partner chose, I had to quickly replace with a different model as the deadline was in hours. 

## What was the most difficult part for me?
I think model choosing is the most difficult part as I don't have sufficient knowledge about different models, it took me time to learn each model and code them right.

## Big take-away
I never knew there are that many of different models availabe for prediction, which greatly expanded my knowledge as I used to work on inferential statistics only. Data sciense is very interesting and I hope I will have some chances to work with big data and prediction modeling in the future.
