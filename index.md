I currently work as a **statistical SAS programmer** for a pharmaceutical consulting company while oversee the programming team for a clinical research study at Havard Medical School.
I am also finishing up my master of statistics degree at NCSU.

The programming languages that help with my daily works are:
*  `SAS`
*  `SQL`
*  `R`
